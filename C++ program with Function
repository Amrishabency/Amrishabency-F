C ++ program with function in students details collection 

ChatGPT
Sure! Here's a simple C++ program that collects details of students using functions:

cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

// Structure to hold student details
struct Student {
    string name;
    int age;
    string address;
};

// Function to input details of a student
void inputStudentDetails(Student& student) {
    cout << "Enter student name: ";
    getline(cin, student.name);
    
    cout << "Enter student age: ";
    cin >> student.age;
    cin.ignore(); // Ignore newline character left in input buffer
    
    cout << "Enter student address: ";
    getline(cin, student.address);
}

// Function to display details of a student
void displayStudentDetails(const Student& student) {
    cout << "Name: " << student.name << endl;
    cout << "Age: " << student.age << endl;
    cout << "Address: " << student.address << endl;
}

int main() {
    int numStudents;
    cout << "Enter the number of students: ";
    cin >> numStudents;
    cin.ignore(); // Ignore newline character left in input buffer

    Student* students = new Student[numStudents];

    // Input details of each student
    for (int i = 0; i < numStudents; ++i) {
        cout << "\nEnter details for student " << (i + 1) << ":" << endl;
        inputStudentDetails(students[i]);
    }

    // Display details of each student
    cout << "\nDetails of all students:" << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < numStudents; ++i) {
        cout << "\nDetails for student " << (i + 1) << ":" << endl;
        displayStudentDetails(students[i]);
    }

    // Free memory allocated for students
    delete[] students;

    return 0;
}

Output:

Enter the number of students: 2

Enter details for student 1:
Enter student name: John Doe
Enter student age: 20
Enter student address: 123 Main St

Enter details for student 2:
Enter student name: Jane Smith
Enter student age: 22
Enter student address: 456 Elm St

Details of all students:

Details for student 1:
Name: John Doe
Age: 20
Address: 123 Main St

Details for student 2:
Name: Jane Smith
Age: 22
Address: 456 Elm St
